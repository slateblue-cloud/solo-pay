# MoAI-ADK Step 2: Execute Implementation (Run) - TDD Implementation

> Architecture: Commands → Agents → Skills. This command orchestrates ONLY through `Task()` tool.
>
> Delegation Model: Phase-based sequential agent delegation. Command orchestrates 4 phases directly.

Workflow: Phase 1 → Analysis & Planning → Phase 2 → TDD Implementation → Phase 3 → Git Operations → Phase 4 → Completion & Guidance.

---

## Command Purpose

Execute TDD implementation of SPEC requirements through complete agent delegation.

The `/moai:2-run` command orchestrates the complete implementation workflow:

1. Phase 1: SPEC analysis and execution plan creation
2. Phase 2: TDD implementation (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
3. Phase 3: Git commit management
4. Phase 4: Completion and next steps guidance

Run on: `$ARGUMENTS` (SPEC ID, e.g., SPEC-001)

---

## Execution Philosophy: "Plan → Run → Sync"

`/moai:2-run` performs SPEC implementation through phase-based sequential agent delegation:

```
User Command: /moai:2-run SPEC-001
    ↓
Phase 1: Task(subagent_type="manager-strategy")
    → SPEC Analysis & Execution Plan Creation
    ↓
Phase 2: Task(subagent_type="manager-tdd")
    → RED → GREEN → REFACTOR TDD Cycle
    ↓
Phase 2.5: Task(subagent_type="manager-quality")
    → TRUST 5 Quality Validation
    ↓
Phase 3: Task(subagent_type="manager-git")
    → Commit Creation & Git Operations
    ↓
Phase 4: AskUserQuestion(...)
    → Completion Summary & Next Steps Guidance
    ↓
Output: Implemented feature with passing tests and commits
```

### Key Principle: Zero Direct Tool Usage

This command uses ONLY these tools:

- Task() for phase agent delegation (manager-strategy → manager-tdd → manager-quality → manager-git)
- AskUserQuestion() for user approval and next steps
- TodoWrite() for task tracking
- No Read/Write/Edit/Bash (all delegated to agents)

Command orchestrates phases sequentially; agents handle complexity.

## Phase Execution Details

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning

Use the manager-strategy subagent to:

1. Read SPEC document
2. Analyze requirements and create execution strategy
3. Return plan for user approval
4. Wait for user confirmation (proceed/modify/postpone)
5. Store plan context for Phase 2

### Phase 2: TDD Implementation

Use the manager-tdd subagent to:

1. Initialize task tracking (TodoWrite)
2. Check domain readiness (if multi-domain SPEC)
3. Execute RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle
4. Return implementation results and coverage metrics

### Phase 2.5: Quality Validation

Use the manager-quality subagent to:

1. Verify TRUST 5 principles (Test-first, Readable, Unified, Secured, Trackable)
2. Validate test coverage (>= 85%)
3. Check security compliance
4. Return quality assessment (PASS/WARNING/CRITICAL)

### Phase 3: Git Operations

Use the manager-git subagent to:

1. Create feature branch if needed
2. Create commits with implementation changes
3. Verify commits were successful
4. Return commit summary

### Phase 4: Completion & Guidance

Command calls `AskUserQuestion()`:

1. Displays implementation summary
2. Shows next action options
3. Guides user to `/moai:3-sync` or additional features

---

## Execution Flow (High-Level)

```
/moai:2-run SPEC-XXX
    ↓
Parse SPEC ID from $ARGUMENTS
    ↓
 Phase 1: manager-strategy subagent
    → Analyze SPEC → Create execution plan → Get approval
    ↓
 Phase 2: manager-tdd subagent
    → RED-GREEN-REFACTOR → Tests passing → Coverage verified
    ↓
 Phase 2.5: manager-quality subagent
    → Validate TRUST 5 principles → Return quality status
    ↓
 Phase 3: manager-git subagent
    → Create feature branch → Commit changes → Verify commits
    ↓
 Phase 4: AskUserQuestion(...)
    → Display summary → Guide next steps → Offer options
    ↓
Output: "Implementation complete. Next step: /moai:3-sync"
```

## Command Implementation

### Sequential Phase Execution

Command implementation flow:

```
# Phase 1: SPEC Analysis & Planning
Use the manager-strategy subagent to:
- Analyze SPEC-$ARGUMENTS and create detailed execution plan
- Extract requirements and success criteria
- Identify implementation phases and tasks
- Determine tech stack and dependencies
- Estimate complexity and effort
- Present step-by-step execution strategy

# User approval checkpoint
AskUserQuestion({
    "question": "Does this execution plan look good?",
    "header": "Plan Review",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
        {"label": "Proceed with plan", "description": "Start implementation"},
        {"label": "Modify plan", "description": "Request changes"},
        {"label": "Postpone", "description": "Stop here, continue later"}
    ]
})

# Phase 2: TDD Implementation (if approved)
if approval == "Proceed with plan":
    Use the manager-tdd subagent to:
    - Execute complete TDD implementation for SPEC-$ARGUMENTS
    - Write failing tests (RED phase)
    - Implement minimal code (GREEN phase)
    - Refactor for quality (REFACTOR phase)
    - Ensure test coverage >= 85%
    - Verify all tests passing

# Phase 2.5: Quality Validation
Use the manager-quality subagent to:
    - Validate implementation against TRUST 5 principles:
      - T: Test-first (tests exist and pass)
      - R: Readable (code is clear and documented)
      - U: Unified (follows project patterns)
      - S: Secured (no security vulnerabilities)
      - T: Trackable (changes are logged and traceable)

Return quality assessment with specific findings.

# Phase 3: Git Operations (Context from previous phases)
if quality_result.status == "PASS" or quality_result.status == "WARNING":
    Use the manager-git subagent to:
    - Create commits for SPEC-$ARGUMENTS implementation
    - The complete context (planning, implementation, quality review) informs meaningful commit messages
    - Create feature branch: feature/SPEC-$ARGUMENTS
    - Stage all relevant files
    - Create meaningful commits (follow conventional commits)
    - Verify commits created successfully
    - Return commit summary with SHA references

# Phase 4: Completion & Guidance
next_steps = AskUserQuestion({
    "question": "Implementation complete. What would you like to do next?",
    "header": "Next Steps",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
        {"label": "Sync Documentation", "description": "/moai:3-sync"},
        {"label": "Implement Another Feature", "description": "/moai:1-plan"},
        {"label": "Review Results", "description": "Examine the implementation"},
        {"label": "Finish", "description": "Session complete"}
    ]
})
```

### Context Flow

Phase Progression:

```
Phase 1: SPEC Analysis
  → Planning context created

Phase 2: Implementation
  → Builds on planning context
  → Implements without re-reading SPEC

Phase 2.5: Quality Validation
  → Uses planning + implementation context
  → Validates with complete feature knowledge

Phase 3: Git Operations
  → Uses complete feature context
  → Creates commits with full understanding
```

Benefits:

- Context Continuity: Full knowledge chain across all phases
- Unified Coding: Phase 1 architectural decisions naturally propagate
- Better Commits: manager-git understands full context for meaningful messages

## Final Step: Next Action Selection

After TDD implementation completes, use AskUserQuestion tool to guide user to next action:

```python
AskUserQuestion({
    "questions": [{
        "question": "Implementation is complete. What would you like to do next?",
        "header": "Next Steps",
        "multiSelect": false,
        "options": [
            {
                "label": "Sync Documentation",
                "description": "Execute /moai:3-sync to organize documentation and create PR"
            },
            {
                "label": "Additional Implementation",
                "description": "Implement more features"
            },
            {
                "label": "Quality Verification",
                "description": "Review tests and code quality"
            }
        ]
    }]
})
```

Important:

- Use conversation language from config
- No emojis in any AskUserQuestion fields
- Always provide clear next step options

## EXECUTION DIRECTIVE

You must NOW execute the command following the "Execution Philosophy" described above.

1. Start Phase 1: Analysis & Planning immediately.
2. Use the manager-strategy subagent.
3. Do NOT just describe what you will do. DO IT.
