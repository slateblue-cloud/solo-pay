# MoAI-ADK Step 9: Feedback Loop

> Architecture: Commands → Agents → Skills. This command orchestrates ONLY through `Task()` tool.
> Delegation Model: Feedback collection delegated to `manager-quality` agent.

Workflow Integration: This command implements the feedback loop of the MoAI workflow, allowing users to report issues or suggestions directly from the CLI.

---

## Command Purpose

Collect user feedback, bug reports, or feature suggestions and create GitHub issues automatically.

Run on: `$ARGUMENTS` (Feedback type)

---

## Execution Philosophy

`/moai:9-feedback` performs feedback collection through agent delegation:

```
User Command: /moai:9-feedback [type]
    ↓
Phase 1: Task(subagent_type="manager-quality")
    → Analyze feedback type
    → Collect details via AskUserQuestion
    → Create GitHub Issue via Skill
    ↓
Output: Issue created with link
```

### Key Principle: Zero Direct Tool Usage

This command uses ONLY these tools:

- Task() for agent delegation
- AskUserQuestion() for user interaction (delegated to agent)
- No Bash (delegated to agent)

## Execution Process

### Step 1: Delegate to Quality Gate Agent

Use the manager-quality subagent to collect and submit user feedback:

Task: Collect user feedback and create a GitHub issue.

Context:

- Feedback Type: $ARGUMENTS (default to 'issue' if empty)
- Conversation Language: {{CONVERSATION_LANGUAGE}}

Instructions:

1. Determine Feedback Type:
   - If $ARGUMENTS is provided, use it.
   - If not, ask user to select type:
     - Bug Report
     - Feature Request
     - Question/Other

2. Collect Details:
   - Ask for 'Title' (short summary)
   - Ask for 'Description' (detailed explanation)
   - Ask for 'Priority' (Low/Medium/High)

3. Create GitHub Issue:
   - Use appropriate tools with GitHub CLI (`gh issue create`) to submit.
   - Add appropriate labels (bug, enhancement, question) via `--label` flag.
   - Format the body with standard templates.

4. Report Result:
   - Show the created issue URL.
   - Confirm success to the user.

Important:

- Use conversation_language for all user interactions.
- NO EMOJIS in AskUserQuestion options.

AskUserQuestion({
    "questions": [{
        "question": "Feedback submitted successfully. What would you like to do next?",
        "header": "Next Steps",
        "multiSelect": false,
        "options": [
            {
                "label": "Continue Development",
                "description": "Return to current workflow"
            },
            {
                "label": "Submit Another Feedback",
                "description": "Report another issue or suggestion"
            },
            {
                "label": "View Issue",
                "description": "Open created GitHub issue in browser"
            }
        ]
    }]
})
```
