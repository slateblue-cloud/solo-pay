# Webhook

::: warning Coming Soon
Webhook functionality is currently in development. The documentation below describes planned features.
:::

Receive real-time notifications when payment status changes.

## Overview

When you set up a Webhook, you can receive HTTP POST requests to your specified URL whenever payment status changes.

::: tip Why Use Webhooks?

- **Real-time notifications**: Immediate notification on status change
- **Server resource savings**: No polling needed
- **Reliability**: Built-in retry mechanism
  :::

## Event Types

| Event               | Description      | When Triggered               |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `payment.created`   | Payment created  | Right after payment creation |

| `payment.expired`   | Payment expired  | After 30 minutes             |

## Payload Structure

```json
{
  "event": "payment.confirmed",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-26T12:35:42Z",
  "data": {
    "paymentId": "0xabc123...",
    "paymentHash": "0xabc123...",
    "status": "CONFIRMED",
    "amount": "10000000",
    "tokenAddress": "0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174",
    "tokenSymbol": "USDC",
    "payerAddress": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
    "recipientAddress": "0xMerchantAddress...",
    "txHash": "0xdef789...",
    "blockNumber": 12345678,
    "merchantOrderId": "order_001",
    "confirmedAt": "2024-01-26T12:35:42Z"
  }
}
```

## Headers

| Header                | Description                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `Content-Type`        | `application/json`                     |
| `X-SoloPay-Signature` | HMAC-SHA256 signature                  |
| `X-SoloPay-Timestamp` | Request creation time (Unix timestamp) |
| `X-SoloPay-Event`     | Event type                             |

## Retry Policy

Webhook delivery failures are retried with exponential backoff.

| Retry | Wait Time  |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 1st   | 1 minute   |
| 2nd   | 5 minutes  |
| 3rd   | 30 minutes |
| 4th   | 2 hours    |
| 5th   | 24 hours   |

After 5 failures, the event is discarded.

## Current Alternative: Polling

Until Webhook is implemented, you can check status using polling.

```typescript
// Payment status polling example
const pollPaymentStatus = async (paymentId: string) => {
  while (true) {
    const result = await client.getPaymentStatus(paymentId);
    const status = result.data.status;

    if (status === 'CONFIRMED' || status === 'FAILED' || status === 'EXPIRED') {
      return status;
    }

    // Wait 2 seconds before retry
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
  }
};
```

## Next Steps

- [Payment Status](/en/payments/status) - Check status via polling
- [Error Codes](/en/api/errors) - Error handling
